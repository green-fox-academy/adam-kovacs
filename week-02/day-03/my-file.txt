Those who try to obtain the favourable attention of a prince
are accustomed to come before him with the things that they 
value most, or which they think the prince will most enjoy.
As a result, one often sees expensive gifts such as horses,
weapons, cloths of gold, precious stones, and similar ornaments 
presented to princes.

Desiring therefore to present myself with some proof of my 
devotion towards you,I have found that the possession I value 
above all is the knowledge of the actions of great men. This 
knowledge has been acquired by long experience in contemporary 
affairs, and a continual study of history. I have reflected on
this long and carefully, and I now send you these reflections 
presented in a small volume.
